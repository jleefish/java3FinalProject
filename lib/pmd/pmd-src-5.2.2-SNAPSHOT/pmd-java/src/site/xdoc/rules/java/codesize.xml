<section name="Code Size">

  
The Code Size ruleset contains rules that find problems related to code size or complexity.
  

<subsection name="NPathComplexity">
<p>Since: PMD 3.9</p>
<p>
The NPath complexity of a method is the number of acyclic execution paths through that method.
A threshold of 200 is generally considered the point where measures should be taken to reduce 
complexity and increase readability.
   </p>
<p>This rule is defined by the following Java class: <a href="../../xref/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/codesize/NPathComplexityRule.html">net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.codesize.NPathComplexityRule</a>
</p>Example(s):
	        	<source>
 
void bar() {	// this is something more complex than it needs to be,
	if (y) {	// it should be broken down into smaller methods or functions
		for (j = 0; j &lt; m; j++) {
			if (j &gt; r) {
				doSomething();
				while (f &lt; 5 ) {
					anotherThing();
					f -= 27;
					}
				} else {
					tryThis();

 <subsection name="ExcessiveMethodLength">
<p>Since: PMD 0.6</p>
<p>
When methods are excessively long this usually indicates that the method is doing more than its
name/signature might suggest. They also become challenging for others to digest since excessive 
scrolling causes readers to lose focus.
Try to reduce the method length by creating helper methods and removing any copy/pasted code.

 <subsection name="ExcessiveParameterList">
<p>Since: PMD 0.9</p>
<p>
Methods with numerous parameters are a challenge to maintain, especially if most of them share the
same datatype. These situations usually denote the need for new objects to wrap the numerous parameters.

 <subsection name="ExcessiveClassLength">
<p>Since: PMD 0.6</p>
<p>
Excessive class file lengths are usually indications that the class may be burdened with excessive 
responsibilities that could be provided by external classes or functions. In breaking these methods
apart the code becomes more managable and ripe for reuse.

Complexity directly affects maintenance costs is determined by the number of decision points in a method 
plus one for the method entry.  The decision points include 'if', 'while', 'for', and 'case labels' calls.  
Generally, numbers ranging from 1-4 denote low complexity, 5-7 denote moderate complexity, 8-10 denote
high complexity, and 11+ is very high complexity.
